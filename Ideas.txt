-Take the smoke off the cannon <Why?>
-Take out some stuff in Boss bot HQ <Why?>
-Fix the cloud collision with toons in party <100% Needed fixed>
-Weekly update on the website

-The "President" HQ <Very Unlikly>
-New Playground
-NPC Gagshop in 4 or level 5 buildings
-Stuff to make after Open Beta
-Night time (Day time for Donald's)
-New Race tracks <Hard But Neat But Also remove laugh points thats part of it>
-New Golf stages <Meh>
-Doodle fighting with you in sos <Could be hard.. new animations WILL be needed>

-Nerf DDL's Toontasks. <Nerf? like make them easyer or harder? if harder I say Your crazy>
-Fix Laggy collisions. Makes that person stop dead in their tracks. <?>
-When you enter the stranded building in tenor terrence. There suppose to be a hole on the other side. When you try to go through that 
hole four cogs from each cog type appear. here are the requested cogs/levels

As you defeat them all you are forced to go down an elevator to the sewer streets. which leads to cog nation. <Thats a lot of coding Not let alone all the 3D art needed!>
<Also I sugest we make custom suits for the cogs protecting cog nation!>





What is needed to be taken off

-Camera in sell bot hq
-When the cog is finished. don't put the cog feet on scale.
-Take the smoke off the cannon
-Take out some stuff in Boss bot HQ
-The game crashing when you hit the clouds from the canon in party mode <Easy fix..>
-Tiles in the brrrgh playground
